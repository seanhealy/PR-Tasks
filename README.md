# PR Tasks

GitHub has long supported the creation of tasks in Pull Requests. It just doesn't
track them. Now it can! No more losing comments on pull requests before they are
resolved. Just make *tasks* with your comments and they will be tracked in the
Pull Request Status.

It will even track issues that GitHub hides that have not yet been resolved.
